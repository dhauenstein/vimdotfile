## About
This is my personal collection of VIM configs and plugins. Feel free to use them, anyhow use them at you own peril :)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository in your home directory:

	`$ git clone https://github.com/dhauenstein/vimdotfile.git ~/.vim`

2. Enter the .vim directory and make sure you execute the Makefile to install all needed plugins:

	`$ make install`
	
	`$ make install-plugins`

3. You may want to install the patched powerline fonts as described [here](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline)
